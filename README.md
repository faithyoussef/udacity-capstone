travel app project setting To get your project up and running,
follow these steps: To make changes and test them out, we need to turn on a special way of working called development mode. We also need to start a program that helps us see our changes on a special number called port 8080.

This is a command that tells the computer to build something for development using a tool called npm. To make something work really well, we have to use a special command called "npm run build-prod". It's like a secret code that helps us make things better. After doing a certain action, a special folder will be made that has everything needed to make the part of the computer that you can see work. 

Then, a command is given to start something that makes the computer talk to the internet at a certain address. This is a command that tells the computer to start running a program called npm. We have two special files called "Configs" that tell the computer how to work when building something. One is for making things while we are testing, and the other is for making things for real. 

The package.json file tells us what we need to use to make a program work. To get information from a special computer program, we need to make a file that has special codes for accessing that program. We will keep this file safe and use it to get the information we need. An API is like a special tool that helps different computer programs talk to each other. We used a few of these tools to make our project work better.

We use different tools to get information about the weather, location, and pictures of a place. We also made sure that our project can work without internet by setting up something called "service workers". When it's working, you'll see a message in your browser. Testing means making sure that something works the way it's supposed to. We use a tool called Jest to do this. To test, we tell the computer to do something by typing a command. Run tests with npm.
